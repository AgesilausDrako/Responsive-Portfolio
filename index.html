					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<img src="assets/images/profile.png" alt="Clay Crawley" id="profile-image">
					<p>
						My name is Clay Crawley. I guess if I have tried to be anything in this crazy life it would be described as: Rennaissance Man.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have a Master's Degree in History and am fluent in several languages including French and Russian.
					</p>
					<p>
						I've lived in several places for varying periods of time including France, Germany, Russia, and Ukraine.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also practice martial arts and have done so for about 30 years now. My main disciplines are Tae Kwon Do and Aikido but I would certainly like to learn more.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like to consider myself as driven and a perfectionist. I certainly hope that's the case.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although I am always afraid of leaving my comfort zone, I seem to have an inner urge to keep doing it. So I guess coding is the next big challenge for me.
